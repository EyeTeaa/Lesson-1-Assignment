# Lesson 1 Assignment

Here you will find my lesson one assigment for 17b. This is a mock bank account console functionality and it works by simple user choices provided by a menu. 

First run the program and you will be presented with a menu of the five choices you can make. 
Choosing any option other than option one (to create a new account) will give you a default bank account where your balance is 0 and your name is John Doe .

From there on out, follow the choices provided by the menu and the console will close when you have inidicated to exit. 
Other than that, if incorrect input is put in, there will be prompts guiding you to the correct input.
